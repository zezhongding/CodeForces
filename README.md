# CodeForces Solutions
*When you are tired of scientific research, come and study programming problems. --Lumiere*

This repository is used to record and share solutions to various coding problems from CodeForces. Each solution is organized by problem number and includes a detailed explanation of the approach and code implementation.

## Structure

- `ProblemNumber/`: Directory containing the solution for the specific problem.
    - `README.md`: Explanation of the problem and the solution approach.
    - `solution.cpp`: C++ implementation of the solution.
    - `solution.py`: Python implementation of the solution (if applicable).

## How to Use
